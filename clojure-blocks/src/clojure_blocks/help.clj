           Hi, welcome to block-world, this set of instructions are writed for letting you get started with block-world in clojure.

           The things that are suppossed to be writen by you at the REPL are noted by ``

           You can start with two of basic commands, probably you already know the first one:
           `(instructions)` which shows this text.

           The second one is `(help \"command\")` which will show you usage for a certain command.

           The next is the result of runnign `(commands)` this command will show you a list of avaliable commands. You can
           write it at any time if you forgot something.
